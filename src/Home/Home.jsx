            <h3>The A. V. Education Society is one of the oldest and pioneering educational societies in the erstwhile Nizams State of Hyderabad.<br/><br/>
            This society was established in the year 1944 (Reg.No.7/52) with an objective to extend educational opportunities to backward sections of the region,
            which were deprived of basic education during the rule of the Nizam. Stalwarts and philanthropists like Sri Raja Bahadur Venkatrama Reddy, Sri Suravaram Pratap Reddy, Sri Konda Venkata Ranga Reddy (Former Deputy Chief Minister), 
            Sri Madapati Hanumantha Rao and Sri J.V. Narsing Rao (Former Deputy Chief Minister) who took part in the Freedom Struggle, Womens Education Movement, Library Movement, and Press Movement were instrumental in the incipience of this great educational society. 
            It was the dream of the founding fathers to start educational institutions that would impart education in the mother tongue i.e., education in Telugu became a reality with the establishment of Andhra Vidyalaya High School, the first Telugu medium school in the erstwhile Nizam's Dominion. <br/><br/>

            A.V. College was established in 1968 as a composite college offering plus two and UG courses. It grew to occupy the status of a multidimensional institution with PG courses.<br/>
            The PG courses were first offered in the year 1991. K.V. Ranga Reddy Law College was set up in the same year.<br/> <br/>
            The Management of the College has been stewarded by great luminaries like the late Justice K. Madhava Reddy, former Chief Justice of High Courts of Telangana and Maharashtra. 
            The present Management Committee consists of Sri.K. Pratap Reddy, a Senior Advocate of Telangana High Court, as the President, Prof. K. Ramchandra Reddy, an eminent Professor of Psychology, as the Vice-President,Prof. G. Prakash Reddy as the Secretary and Dr. K. Gautami, as the correspondent.<br/>

            The Magazine India Today has consecutively rated A.V. College is one of the best colleges in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.<br/><br/>

            With a long and rewarding history of achievements behind us, our Society continues to move forward together with confidence, pride and enthusiasm and our Alumni with successful careers have proved how effective and operational our education system is, as our students have seized name and fame in every domain possible.
